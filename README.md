# Introduction 

This repository contains a Simulation project for the Flexible Automation course in Robotics Engineering Degree 2021. A **Coppeliasim Simulation Scene** is to be developed to solve the problem that is stated below. 

## Problem Statement 

A car engine parts manufacturer approaches you seeking a robotics automated solution for one of their problems in their loading and unloading station. The station receives three parts of the engine. The Job of the station is to segregate the products and load it to the appropriate loading line. The task is to design a flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) with robot centered layout for the above function.
